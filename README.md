PegasusDemo
===========

Something to keep in mind while learning about the Pegasus Workflow is that it can make it easier to run many jobs that use  at least some of the same resources. Most of setting it up involves describing the available resources (files, programs, disk space, etc). In the tutorial virtual machine, all of this set up has been done for you.  
 * The Site Catalog (e.g. "sites.xml") has configurations of computers (or nodes) that can be used to run jobs.  
 * The Transformation Catalog (e.g. "tc.dat") tells what programs are available on which machines.  
 * The Replica Catalog (e.g. "rc.dat") lists available input files and gives them short, easy to us "logical file names".
