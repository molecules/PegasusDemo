===========

Something to keep in mind while learning about the Pegasus Workflow is that it can make it easier to run many jobs that use  at least some of the same resources. Most of setting it up involves describing the available resources (files, programs, disk space, etc). In the tutorial virtual machine, all of this set up has been done for you. The Site Catalog (e.g. "sites.xml") tells about what computers and file systems to use for running jobs. The Transformation Catalog (e.g. "tc.dat") tells what programs are available on which machines (DOUBLE CHECK THIS DESCRIPTION). The Replica Catalog (e.g. "rc.dat") tells what input files can be used for the workflows and gives them short, easy to use "logical file names".
